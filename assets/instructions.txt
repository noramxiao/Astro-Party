GAMEPLAY TIPS
1. **Stay on the Move:** Constantly moving makes it harder for opponents to hit you.
2. **Strategic Shooting:** Time your shots and aim carefully to increase your chances of hitting your target.
3. **Use Boost Wisely:** Boosting can help you dodge bullets and reposition quickly, but it has a cooldown. Use it strategically.
4. **Know the Maps:** Familiarize yourself with different map layouts. Knowing where obstacles and cover are can give you a tactical advantage.
5. **Team Coordination:** In team modes, communicate with your teammates. Coordinated attacks and defenses are much more effective.

#### Advanced Techniques
- **Ricochet Shots:** Some levels have walls that can bounce your shots. Use them to hit opponents around corners.
- **Boost Dodge:** Perfect timing on your boosts can help you dodge incoming shots and make quick escapes.
- **Trap Setting:** Lure opponents into tight spaces or traps where they have less room to maneuver.

Customize your game experience by adjusting the settings:
- **Match Duration:** Set how long each match lasts.
- **Respawn Time:** Adjust the time it takes for players to respawn.
- **Power-Ups:** Enable or disable power-ups that can give players temporary advantages.
